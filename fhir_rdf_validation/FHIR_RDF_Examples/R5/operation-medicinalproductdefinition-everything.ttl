  fhir:comment [ fhir:v "The key differences between this operation and simply performing a search and using _include and _revinclude are:    \n\n* unless the client requests otherwise, the server returns the entire result set in a single bundle (rather than using paging)  \n* the server is responsible for determining what resources to return as included resources (rather than the client specifying which ones). \n\nThis frees the client from needing to determine what it could or should ask for, particularly with regard to included resources. It also makes for a much shorter and easier to construct query string. Servers should consider returning appropriate Provenance and AuditTrail on the returned resources, even though these are not directly part of the product data. \n\nWhen this operation is used to access multiple product records at once, the return bundle could be rather a lot of data; servers may choose to require that such requests are made [asynchronously](async.html), and associated with [bulk data formats](resource-formats.html#bulk). Alternatively, clients may choose to page through the result set (or servers may require this). Paging through the results is done the same as for [Searching](http.html#paging), using the [_count](search.html#count) parameter, and Bundle links. Implementers should note that paging will be slower than simply returning all the results at once (more network traffic, multiple latency delays) but may be required in order not to exhaust available memory reading or writing the whole response in a single package. Unlike searching, there is no inherent user-display order for the $everything operation. Servers might consider sorting the returned resources in descending order of last record update, but are not required to do so.\n\nThe _since parameter is provided to support periodic queries to get additional information that has changed about the product since the last query. This means that the _since parameter is based on record time. The value of the _since parameter should be set to the time from the server. If using direct response, this is the timestamp in the response header. If using the async interface, this is the transaction timestamp in the json response. Servers should ensure that the timestamps a managed such that the client does not miss any changes. Clients should be able to handle getting the same response more than once in the case that the transaction falls on a time boundary. Clients should ensure that the other query parameters are constant to ensure a coherent set of records when doing periodic queries."] ;
